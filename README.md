# Embedded-Reber-grammars

Embedded Reber grammars are a type of artificial grammar used in the study of cognitive psychology and language processing. They were introduced by the American psychologist Theodore Reber in the 1960s to investigate the ability of individuals to learn and generate structured sequences, often as a means to understand the nature of human language processing.

Embedded Reber grammars consist of a set of rules for generating strings of symbols. The symbols are typically letters, such as 'B,' 'P,' 'T,' 'X,' 'S,' and 'E.' These grammars have a hierarchical structure, meaning that they involve the embedding of one sequence within another.

A typical Embedded Reber grammar includes a series of connected states and transitions, forming a graph-like structure. Participants in experiments involving these grammars are asked to learn the rules and generate valid strings according to the grammar. The challenge is that the rules can be quite complex and require recognizing patterns within patterns.

Embedded Reber grammars are used to study various cognitive processes, including learning, memory, and problem-solving. They are often employed in experimental settings to assess a person's ability to acquire and generalize complex rule-based structures. These grammars have been particularly useful for investigating how people learn and process hierarchical structures in language and other domains.

In summary, Embedded Reber grammars are a specific type of artificial grammar designed for experimental purposes, typically used to study cognitive processes related to learning and processing hierarchical structures.
